# Tōchō 盗聴 - a simple irc logging bot built on node-irc and nstore.

*overview*

just another sketch in node.js. I usually can't be on the node.js channel all the time, so this bot is run off a cheap shell on one background process.

there's already the official logs of course, but nstore lets me potentially do a search for my favorite guys...etc

and of course, it's just plain good fun on weekend late nights to put some node goodies together.

*requirements*

- node.js (duh!)
- npm
- use npm install node-irc
- nStore if you want to save the conversations to Tim Caswell's nStore instead of a plain vanilla text file.

*settings*

see config.js

*run bot*

`node bot.js`
