# TODO

1. search.js (search for your conversations)

2. break.js (split conversations to a smaller document in nstore)

3. auto email conversations in digest form

4. simple piping of the messages to a webpage using sockets.io (node version for server-end and web version for frontend html)

5. express/fab (any good framework to handle the html...etc, unless you like it the hard way)
